All cells in human body containing same genetic information but different cell in the body use different part of that information. Gene expression and epigentic signature of cells define the identity of the cells in our body. It has been recently pappreciated by researchers that there are variabiltiy among same cell type. Why cells are different from their neighboring cells. Overarching goals of my research is to understand how genetic information stored in the nucleus expressed differently in different cell types in human liver. I am using single cell RNA-seq and single molecule flouresence in situ hybridization to investigate how spatial context of the cells in liver tissue aftect gene expression and function.
