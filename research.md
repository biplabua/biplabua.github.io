Overarching goals of my research is to understand how genetic information stored in the nucleus expressed differently in different cell types in human liver. I am asking this question based on the skills I developed during my training as Masters and PhD study. In my masters I learnt use of light microscopy and Atomic force microscopy. During my PhD research I developed the skill of single molecule imaging and gained the knowledge of RNA biology. I have published one first author research paper and a method paper from my masters work. Then I became more interested in molecular cell biology, and worked on the link between non conding RNA processing and mRNA biology in my PhD. So far I have published one research paper of my PhD work and another paper are going to be published soon.
